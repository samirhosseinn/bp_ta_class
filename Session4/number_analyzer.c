/*
Write a program that repeatedly lets the user choose an operation to perform on a number.
The program should continue running until the user selects 0 (Exit).

### Menu

========== Number Analyzer ==========
1. Check if the number is Prime
2. Count the digits of the number
3. Reverse the number
4. Calculate the sum of its digits
5. Compute factorial (recursive)
6. Print numbers from 1 to n (recursive)
0. Exit
-------------------------------------
Enter your choice:

###Program Requirements

After the user enters a choice (1–6), the program must ask the user to enter a number.

Based on the chosen option, call the appropriate function to process the number.

Display the result to the user.

When the user enters 0, the program should stop.

Use separate functions for each operation.

Factorial and printing 1 to n must be implemented using recursion.

Other functions may use loops.


### Example flow
Enter your choice: 2
Enter a number: 5831
Digit count: 4

Enter your choice: 5
Enter a number: 6
Factorial = 720

Enter your choice: 0
Program terminated.
